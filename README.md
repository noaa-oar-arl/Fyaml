## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fyaml/fyaml.git
cd fyaml
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
make install
```

### Basic Usage

```fortran
program example
    use fyaml
    implicit none

    type(fyaml_t) :: yml
    integer :: max_iterations, rc
    real(fyaml_yp) :: tolerance
    character(len=fyaml_StrLen) :: output_file
    integer, dimension(3) :: grid_size

    ! Add configuration values
    call fyaml_add(yml, "solver%max_iterations", 1000, "Maximum iterations", rc)
    call fyaml_add(yml, "solver%tolerance", 1.0e-6_fyaml_yp, "Convergence tolerance", rc)
    call fyaml_add(yml, "output%file", "results.dat", "Output filename", rc)
    call fyaml_add(yml, "grid%size", [100, 100, 50], "Grid dimensions", rc)

    ! Read configuration values back
    call fyaml_get(yml, "solver%max_iterations", max_iterations, rc)
    call fyaml_get(yml, "solver%tolerance", tolerance, rc)
    call fyaml_get(yml, "output%file", output_file, rc)
    call fyaml_get(yml, "grid%size", grid_size, rc)

    ! Clean up
    call fyaml_cleanup(yml)
end program
```

## Building and Testing

### Standard Build

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### With Tests

```bash
cmake .. -DFYAML_BUILD_TESTS=ON
make
ctest --output-on-failure
```

**Test Suite Overview:**
- 🧪 **18 comprehensive test programs** covering all functionality
- ✅ **100% test pass rate** - all tests consistently pass
- 🔍 **API Coverage**: Complete testing of `fyaml_add`, `fyaml_get`, `fyaml_update`, `fyaml_add_get`
- 📊 **Data Types**: Full coverage for integers, reals, booleans, strings (scalars and arrays)
- 🎯 **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive testing of boundary conditions and error paths
- 📈 **Array Testing**: Various sizes, patterns, and multidimensional-like structures

### Code Coverage

To generate code coverage reports:

```bash
# Install coverage tools (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install lcov

# Configure with coverage
cmake .. -DFYAML_ENABLE_COVERAGE=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build and run tests
make
ctest

# Generate coverage report
make coverage
```

This will create an HTML coverage report in `coverage-html/` that you can open in your browser.

### GitHub Actions

The project includes automated testing and coverage reporting:

- **CI Workflow**: Builds and tests on multiple platforms
- **Coverage Workflow**: Generates coverage reports and uploads them as artifacts
- **Documentation**: Automatically builds and deploys documentation

Coverage reports are automatically generated for pull requests and can be downloaded as artifacts from the GitHub Actions page.

## CMake Integration

### Using find_package

```cmake
find_package(FYAML REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE FYAML::fyaml)
```

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup development environment
git clone https://github.com/fyaml/fyaml.git
cd fyaml

# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install gfortran cmake

# macOS with Homebrew
brew install gcc cmake

# Build with all options enabled
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DFYAML_ENABLE_COVERAGE=ON
make

# Run full test suite
ctest --output-on-failure

# Generate coverage report (requires GCC)
make coverage
```

### Coverage Testing

FYAML includes comprehensive coverage testing using `gcov`. To run coverage analysis:

```bash
# Using the provided script (macOS with Homebrew)
./scripts/run_coverage.sh

# Or manually
mkdir build-coverage && cd build-coverage
cmake .. -DFYAML_ENABLE_COVERAGE=ON -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
make coverage
```

**Current Coverage Statistics:**
- 📊 **Overall Project**: 89.4% coverage (2,474 of 2,767 lines executed)
- 🎯 **Main API Module**: 74.4% coverage (fyaml.f90 - 484 of 651 lines executed)
- ✅ **Test Files**: Near 100% coverage across all test programs
- 🔍 **Key Modules**: High coverage across all critical components

Coverage reports are generated as `.gcov` files showing line-by-line execution data. Lines marked with `#####` indicate code that wasn't executed and may need additional test coverage.
